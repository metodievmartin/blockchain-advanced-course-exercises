## Exercise: Security in Smart Contract Development

### Smart Contract Security Challenges

Smart contract security is one of the most critical aspects of blockchain development. With millions of dollars locked in smart contracts, a single vulnerability can lead to catastrophic losses. This homework aims to strengthen your understanding of common security vulnerabilities and their prevention through hands-on practice with carefully selected challenges.

We encourage you to attempt as many additional challenges as possible from the **Ethernaut** platform, as each challenge provides unique insights into different security aspects. Remember: in the blockchain world, security isn't just a feature â€” it's a fundamental requirement.

### Tasks

You must complete the following challenges from the **Ethernaut** challenges:

* **Ethernaut Level 11**: Elevator
* **Ethernaut Level 9**: King
* **Ethernaut Level 16**: Preservation
* **Ethernaut Level 22**: Dex Two 

### Additional Notes

* Each solution must demonstrate understanding of the security concepts covered in class
* Follow the **Checks-Effects-Interactions** pattern and other security best practices discussed
* Implement proper testing to verify your solutions
