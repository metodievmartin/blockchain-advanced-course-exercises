     * Exploit summary:
     *
     * 1. Deploy the `KingAttack` contract with 1001 wei, making it capable of claiming kingship.
     *    This is more than the current prize (1000 wei), so it meets the requirement.
     *
     * 2. Call `attack()` from the attacker contract, which sends its entire balance
     *    to the King contract. This makes the attacker contract the new king.
     *
     * 3. The attacker contract includes a `receive()` function that always reverts.
     *    This means when someone else tries to become king, the King contract's
     *    `.transfer()` to the current king (our attacker) will fail and revert the transaction.
     *
     * 4. As a result, no other address can successfully become king, causing a
     *    Denial of Service (DoS) â€” the kingship is permanently locked to the attacker.
